# LXD containers specific vars
# The password here is `sekret` and is generated using `mkpasswd --method=SHA-512`
# `sudo apt install whois` if `mkpasswd` is not on your system
# I know `sekret` isn't very secure and neither is the hashing algorithm `SHA-512`, but
# we're only ever going to use the variables on your local machine inside the LXD containers.
